Poposal: Tracker algorithm description
1. Find all objects with YoloV3
2. For each object collect features by color
    RGB2HSV, build HUE histpgram with np.histogram
3. Normolize (1/1920) and grayscale
4. Get new points with Optical Flow (cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK)
5. if new_point - old > threshold then shift by prediction
6. Hungarian algorithm
    build distance matrix, map by threshold
7. Update centers
8. Forget too old objects
9. Create new objects
10. Do prediction
    LSQR (qv regression)
    LSTM (with normalization: -center, /maximum)
11. Renorm HUE with PCA
